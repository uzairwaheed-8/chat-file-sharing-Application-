# chat-file-sharing-Application-
Semester project for Computer Network

# Workflow:
Multiple users can connect and chat with each other, the function is
implemented by creating threads, every new user has its own thread. For File transfer
and exit, we have to send specific commands in chat that trigger specific 
functionalities. When we send ‘$ft’ in chat file transfers from client to server, when we 
send ‘$rt’ the server, first it send the names of the files present in its directory to client 
then client enters the name of the file it want to download from server and when we 
send ‘$exit’ client get disconnected from server.
